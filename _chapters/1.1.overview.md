# Fixing the World

One of the troubles facing visual effects- and game-facilities is maintaining a fixed level of quality throughout resources shared amongst artists within an organisation. Pyblish is a plug-in driven automation framework for content and solves exactly this.

## Benefits

Some of the immediate benefits of using Pyblish are

- [Higher quality content](#higher-quality-content)
- [Greater content reuse](#greater-reuse-of-content)
- [Lower iteration times](#lower-iteration-time)
- [Shortened learning curve](#shortened-learning-curve)

#### Higher quality content

> Funnel content through strict procedures and provide guidance to fellow artists on how they can improve and follow convention. By the end of this, you'll end up with a uniform library of resources that all live up to your pre-defined measure of quality and a confidence that any resource fits any circumstance.


#### Greater reuse of content

> Global quality measures can help you in reusing resources produced in one project together with resources built for another. As a result, every asset becomes an investment in the future.


#### Lower iteration time

> Sending resources back to their original creator is a major time sink. This can be reduced drastically, providing artists with the confidence to both contribute and use resources created by someone else.

#### Shortened learning curve

> Without conventions, each resource is an island. Remove ad-hoc procedures and unify the interactions between every resource; have artists know with absolute certainty that if they can handle a resources of one class, they can handle any resource of the same class.


# What Is Publishing

> Funnel the output of individual artists so as to streamline retrieval, automation and understanding of an otherwise overwhelming amount of data.

Publishing is what Pyblish is all about. But what exactly is "publishing"?

The concept may originally have descended from from software development, in which the term *testing* refers to..

In the illustration above, no testing or validation takes place, thus leaving your assets vulnerable to error. Each error then trickles through your pipeline, from artist to artist, until it will eventually have to be sent back from whence it came. Sound familiar?

With publishing, errors can be caught *before* they get a chance to infect any part of your pipeline. The end result is happier developers, happier artists and happier clients.
