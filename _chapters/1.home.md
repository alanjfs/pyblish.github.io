Pyblish is a **free**, open-source (LGPL) framework written in Python that brings test-driven development to visual effects and AAA game creation.

### What is it?


Pyblish answers the two most commonly asked questions by artists and technical directors.

```
   _________________________              _______________________________
  /                         \      |     /                               \
 | - Where do I save it?     |     |    | How do I get artists to..       |
 | - How do I format it?     |     |    |   - save in the proper place?   | 
  \___________________________\    |    /_  - format appropriately?       |
                                o  |  o   \______________________________/
                                /| | |\
                               / | | | \
           The Artist              |                The TD
```

Technically, Pyblish is a test-runner and file exporter. The idea being that you export only what has passes the tests.

Clearly stating what Pyblish is and does has been a challenge since it was born.

To those familiar with publishing in major studios, odds are it's very similar. The issue lies in how different publishing is to different people and studios. For example, some test and some do not. Pyblish assumes you do.

For others, feel free to consider it a test-runner, much like `nose`. But where `nose` applies to software, Pyblish applies to content - the kind of content you create in Maya, Nuke, Photoshop, Zbrush and Mari etc. In those cases, `nose` is less of an ideal choice, due to the end user being artists and not software developers. Artists needs something tangible and up-front, something they can interact with.

Some have reported this summary to make sense.

But for most users, considering they have *no* prior experience with publishing, skimming the getting started guide is the most direct route to knowing whether it is for you or not.

### What are users saying?

I love Pyblish!

> David Martinez - Character TD at TT Games

Pyblish is an ideal framework that modularises publishing workflow for visual effects by use of small functions and clear data types while providing wide-ranging functionality.

> Lars van der Bijl - Head of Pipeline at Realise

Pyblish is what enables our artists to focus more on the artistic barrier of raising quality instead of the technical one whilst maintaining a pipeline that raises the bar for both.

> Roy Nieterau - Director at Colorbleed

I'm boarding this ship.

> Milan Kolar - VFX Supervisor at Kredenc

Clean, small yet powerful. Redefined the way content has been saved and visualized.

> Liju Kunnummal - Pipeline Developer at Prime Focus

Working across multiple pipelines, Pyblish is a much needed common framework. Pyblish allows me to fix problems in one production and instantly propagate the solutions to other productions.

> Toke Jepsen - Technical Director at Bait Studio
 
I am really excited about using Pyblish on our next production.

> SveinbjÃ¶rn J. Tryggvason - Pipeline Overlord at CAOZ

### Cross-platform, cross-software

Pyblish is designed to unify artists, platform and software under a single publishing mechanism. Written in cross-compatible pure-Python 2 and 3, Pyblish runs wherever Python runs (and in places where it does not).

**Supported software**

- [Autodesk Softimage](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-softimage)

### Graphical User Interfaces

As a framework, developing your own bespoke GUI is entirely possible. Pyblish maintains two reference implementations for you to get started with.

![pyblish-qml](/images/pyblish-qml.gif)

[**pyblish-qml**](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-qml)

Focus on features, user experience and bleeding edge technology via Qt QML and OpenGL, pyblish-qml is the first and most complete implementation of Pyblish, requires PyQt5.

- [More](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-qml)

[**pyblish-lite**](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-lite)

Minimalism and compatibility lies in focus here, this requires any version of Python between 2.6-3.5 along with either PySide, PySide2, PyQt4 or PyQt5. pyblish-lite is a great fallback when having trouble with pyblish-qml.
