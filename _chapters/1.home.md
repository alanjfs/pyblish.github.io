Pyblish is a **free**, open-source (LGPL) framework written in Python that brings test-driven development to visual effects and AAA game creation.

### What is it?

Pyblish provides a mechanism with which to implement a "publishing" pipeline.

- [What is publishing](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish/wiki/What-is-publishing)

It answers the two most commonly asked questions by artists and technical directors.

```
   _________________________              _______________________________
  /                         \      |     /                               \
 | - Where do I save it?     |     |    | How do I get artists to..       |
 | - How do I format it?     |     |    |   - save in the proper place?   | 
  \___________________________\    |    /_  - format appropriately?       |
                                o  |  o   \______________________________/
                                /| | |\
                               / | | | \
            Artist                 |                    TD
```

Technically, Pyblish is different things to different people.

- To the software developer, Pyblish is a test-runner for content.
- To the technical director, Pyblish provides the means to define and programatically enforce a set of rules for how content must be formatted.
- To the artist, Pyblish enables an unambiguous delivery of content.

Beyond that, feel free to skim the [hello world](http://learn.pyblish.com/chapters/01-hello-world.html) example to get a better understanding of what it *really* is.

### What are users saying?

I love Pyblish!

> David Martinez - Character TD at TT Games

Pyblish is an ideal framework that modularises publishing workflow for visual effects by use of small functions and clear data types while providing wide-ranging functionality.

> Lars van der Bijl - Head of Pipeline at Realise

Pyblish is what enables our artists to focus more on the artistic barrier of raising quality instead of the technical one whilst maintaining a pipeline that raises the bar for both.

> Roy Nieterau - Director at Colorbleed

I'm boarding this ship.

> Milan Kolar - VFX Supervisor at Kredenc

Clean, small yet powerful. Redefined the way content has been saved and visualized.

> Liju Kunnummal - Pipeline Developer at Prime Focus

Working across multiple pipelines, Pyblish is a much needed common framework. Pyblish allows me to fix problems in one production and instantly propagate the solutions to other productions.

> Toke Jepsen - Technical Director at Bait Studio
 
I am really excited about using Pyblish on our next production.

### Cross-platform, cross-software

Pyblish is designed to unify artists, platform and software under a single publishing mechanism. Written in cross-compatible pure-Python 2 and 3, Pyblish runs wherever Python runs (and in places where it does not).

### Graphical User Interfaces

As a framework, developing your own bespoke GUI is entirely possible. Pyblish maintains two reference implementations for you to get started with.

![pyblish-qml](/images/pyblish-qml.gif)

[**pyblish-qml**](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-qml)

Focus on features, user experience and bleeding edge technology via Qt QML and OpenGL, pyblish-qml is the first and most complete implementation of Pyblish, requires PyQt5.

- [More](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-qml)

[**pyblish-lite**](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-lite)

Minimalism and compatibility lies in focus here, this requires any version of Python between 2.6-3.5 along with either PySide, PySide2, PyQt4 or PyQt5. pyblish-lite is a great fallback when having trouble with pyblish-qml.
