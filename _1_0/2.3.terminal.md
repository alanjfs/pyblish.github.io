# The Terminal

In the following chapters, we will learn about and actually perform publishing. We will be using the command-line interface of Pyblish, also known as `cli`, so before we get started let's have a quick look at how to use it.

### Running

You can access Pyblish from the command-line by typing `pyblish`.

```bash
$ pyblish
```

It won't do anything on it's own, but we can make it print some useful information for you by passing it a `--verbose` flag.

```bat
$ pyblish --verbose
Pyblish 1.0.3 - publish

Custom data @ None
Custom configuration @ None

Available plugin paths:
    - C:\Users\marcus\Desktop\github\pyblish\pyblish\plugins

Available plugins:
    - SelectCurrentDate
    - SelectCurrentWorkingDirectory
    - SelectCurrentUser
    - ValidateNamingConvention
```

Let's try asking it for help.

```bash
$ pyblish --help
```

`--help` is an argument and passing it to `pyblish` will have it print some documentation for us on how the `cli` works. 

In addition to passing arguments, you can pass commands. Let's try the `publish` command.

```bash
$ pyblish publish
```

This discover available plugins and execute them, one by one.

```bash
SelectCurrentDate...
SelectCurrentWorkingDirectory...
SelectFiles...
SelectCurrentUser...
ValidateNamingConvention...
ValidateFiles...
ExtractReversedFiles...

```

> Protip: try passing both `--verbose` *and* `publish`.
