# Publishing

Now that we've got our foothold on the command-line, let's try to actually publish something.

In this chapter, we will:

1. Select files from a directory.
2. Validate that none of the selected files are above a certain size.
3. Compress the selected files.
4. Print a message to the user about what has happened.

### Selecting files

If you think back to [How it works][works], you'll remember that the first step in producing a publish is to determine what to actually publish. This process is called selection and works like this.

1. A publish is triggered
2. Pyblish finds plugins of type "Selector"
3. Pyblish runs each Selector

Each selector is responsible for identifying what is to be processed by subsequent plugins - validators, extractors and conformers.

In our case, we'd like to "select" files from within a directory, as it is these files we'd like to process further.
