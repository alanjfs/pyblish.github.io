        <p>Pyblish is a feature film-strength quality assurance framework for content.</p>

<h1>
<a name="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h1>

<p>Some of the immediate benefits of using Pyblish are</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#higher-quality-content">Higher quality content</a></li>
<li><a href="#greater-reuse-of-content">Greater content reuse</a></li>
<li><a href="#lower-iteration-time">Lower iteration times</a></li>
<li><a href="#shortened-learning-curve">Shortened learning curve</a></li>
</ul><h5>
<a name="higher-quality-content" class="anchor" href="#higher-quality-content"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Higher quality content</h5>

<p>When looking out over your content, it can be difficult to know what quality standards it all falls under. Some files may have been perfected while others may be haphazardly put together by an intern. Passing data through validations is one way of reducing the range of quality differences throughout your library of content.</p>

<h5>
<a name="greater-reuse-of-content" class="anchor" href="#greater-reuse-of-content"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Greater reuse of content</h5>

<p>Traditionally, as projects come and go, you tend to end up with a rather large library of assets. Unfortunately, most of these assets are often tightly tailored to their parent project and rarely usable once complete. But when content from Project A looks and works similar to Project B, it isn't too far of a stretch to imagine it fitting in with Project C, D and E as well.</p>

<h5>
<a name="lowered-iteration-time" class="anchor" href="#lowered-iteration-time"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lowered iteration time</h5>

<p>Sending content back to the artist responsible for creating it is a major time sink. Due to data being validated prior to being passed on using Pyblish, this can be reduced drastically and artists can share content effortlessly and with confident that it will work.</p>

<h5>
<a name="shortened-learning-curve" class="anchor" href="#shortened-learning-curve"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Shortened learning curve</h5>

<p>When validating data, the state of each file may come as less of a surprise to the artist making use of it. Traditionally, handing data from one artist to another typically involves an ad-hoc process of one explaining his methods and conventions to the other so that the content can be continued upon. With Pyblish, an organisation can pre-define conventions upon each category of content so as to minimise the amount of new information present within each file.</p>

<p>This works both ways, a new artists sharing his work with others must first become comfortable with the conventions already in place. Traditionally, this is a process of trail and error where an artist must study the implicit conventions of others and continually make improvements upon his work until it conforms to the overall quality produced by his peers. This comes at a cost not only to himself, but to others who discover the flaws and send it back. A process known as "passing shit downstream". With Pyblish, this can be drastically reduced and artist, both veteran or novice, can confidently provide others with content living up to par with the organisation.</p>

<a name="integrations" class="anchor" href="#integrations"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Integrations</h1>

<p>You've just installed Pyblish, but Pyblish isn't much without any of its integrations. Let's have a look at the Maya integration.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/abstractfactory/pyblish-maya/wiki"><img src="https://github.com/abstractfactory/pyblish/wiki/images/maya-pyblish.png" alt=""></a></p>

<h1>
<a name="installing-the-maya-integration" class="anchor" href="#installing-the-maya-integration"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing the Maya integration</h1>

<p>If you haven't already installed Pyblish, head on over the the <a href="https://github.com/abstractfactory/pyblish/wiki/Installing">Pyblish installation guide</a> to get started. Once ready, run this.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-bash"><pre><span class="c"># Pyblish for Maya is a regular Python package on PyPI</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>pip install pyblish-maya
</pre></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Currently, Pyblish only works with Maya 2014 and upwards.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
<a name="installing-the-integration-into-maya" class="anchor" href="#installing-the-integration-into-maya"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing the integration into Maya</h3>

<p>The next step is to expose the integration to Maya. For this, you've got two options.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Append a <code>userSetup.py</code> to your PYTHONPATH</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-bash"><pre><span class="c"># Typically, the integration is located here</span>
c:<span class="se">\P</span>ython27<span class="se">\L</span>ib<span class="se">\s</span>ite-packages<span class="se">\p</span>yblish_maya<span class="se">\p</span>ythonpath
</pre></div>

<p>Append this path to your <code>PYTHONPATH</code>. See here for <a href="https://github.com/abstractfactory/pyblish/wiki/Adding-an-environment-variable">help with modifying your environment</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Append to your own <code>userSetup.py</code></p>

<p>How about a cube.</p>

<ol>
<li>In your <code>Create</code> menu</li>
<li>Click <code>Polygon Primitives</code>
</li>
<li>Click <code>Cube</code>
</li>
<li>Rename your cube to "myCube"</li>
</ol><p>Or type the following in your script editor.</p>

<h3>
<a name="publish---1st-attempt" class="anchor" href="#publish---1st-attempt"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Publish - 1st attempt</h3>

<p>Allright, let's try publishing.</p>

<ol>
<li>In your <code>File</code> menu</li>
<li>Click <code>Publish</code>
</li>
</ol><p>Or type the following:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-python"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pyblish.main</span>
<span class="n">pyblish</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">main</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">publish_all</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Hmm. You're cube should have been published by now, but instead you've got a message saying:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-python"><pre><span class="c"># No instances found. # </span>
</pre></div>

<p>What is that all about? As it turns out, there are just a few more steps we'll need to take before the button will know of exactly what and how you would like to perform your publish.</p>

<h3>
<a name="select-it" class="anchor" href="#select-it"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Select it</h3>

<p><em>Select</em> is an important keyword in Pyblish. To <em>Select</em>, in Pyblish, means to specify what you would like to have published.</p>

<p>To select your cube, add it to a selection set.</p>

<ol>
<li>In your <code>Create</code> menu</li>
<li>Click <code>Sets</code>
</li>
<li>Followed by <code>Set</code>
</li>
<li>Rename your set to "MyCube"</li>
</ol><p>Or, type the following:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-python"><pre><span class="n">cmds</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sets</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'MyCube'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If you didn't have <code>myCube</code> selected when you created the set, make sure to add it to the set, either by dragging-and-dropping or by typing:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-python"><pre><span class="n">cmds</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sets</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'myCube'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">addElement</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'MyCube'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<h3>
<a name="publish---2nd-attempt" class="anchor" href="#publish---2nd-attempt"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Publish - 2nd attempt</h3>

<p>Allright, let's try that again.</p>

<ol>
<li>In your <code>File</code> menu</li>
<li>Click <code>Publish</code>
</li>
</ol><p>Or type the following:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-python"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pyblish.main</span>
<span class="n">pyblish</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">main</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">publish_all</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Hmm, we're still missing something.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-python"><pre><span class="c"># No instances found. # </span>
</pre></div>

<h3>
<a name="make-it-publishable" class="anchor" href="#make-it-publishable"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Make it publishable</h3>

<p>For Pyblish to know that <em>this</em> is what you would like to Publish, and nothing else, we need to tag the selection set. To tag it, add the following attributes and values.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-yaml"><pre><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">publishable (bool)</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">True</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">family (string)</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">"demo.model"</span>
</pre></div>

<p>You can add it by going to your <a href="http://download.autodesk.com/global/docs/maya2014/en_us/files/GUID-424694BA-019A-4D05-86EF-F9CD0A69D92C.htm">Channel Box</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>In your <code>Edit</code> menu</li>
<li>Click <code>Add Attribute</code>
</li>
<li>Type <code>publishable</code> as <code>Long name</code>
</li>
<li>Click <code>Boolean</code> as <code>Data Type</code>
</li>
<li>Hit <code>Add</code>
</li>
<li>Type <code>family</code> as <code>Long name</code>
</li>
<li>Click <code>String</code> as <code>Data Type</code>
</li>
<li>Hit <code>OK</code>
</li>
</ol><p>Or type the following:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-python"><pre><span class="n">cmds</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">addAttr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'MyCube'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">at</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'bool'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">longName</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'publishable'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">cmds</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">addAttr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'MyCube'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">dt</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'string'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">longName</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'family'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Next, fill in the values.</p>

<ol>
<li>In your <a href="http://download.autodesk.com/global/docs/maya2014/en_us/files/GUID-67A58D31-4722-4769-B3E6-1A35B5B53BED.htm">Attribute Editor</a>
</li>
<li>Under <code>Extra Attributes</code>
</li>
<li>Toggle <code>publishable</code> to True</li>
<li>Type <code>demo.model</code> in the <code>family</code> text box</li>
</ol><p>Or type the following:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-python"><pre><span class="n">cmds</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">setAttr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'MyCube.publishable'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">cmds</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">setAttr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'MyCube.family'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'demo.model'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'string'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Now Pyblish will be able to distinguish between this set and any other set you might have.</p>

<h3>
<a name="publish---3rd-attempt" class="anchor" href="#publish---3rd-attempt"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Publish - 3rd attempt</h3>

<p>Third time's the charm, right?</p>

<ol>
<li>In your <code>File</code> menu</li>
<li>Click <code>Publish</code>
</li>
</ol><p>Or type the following:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-python"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pyblish.main</span>
<span class="n">pyblish</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">main</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">publish_all</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>

<p><strong>Error!</strong></p>

<div class="highlight highlight-python"><pre><span class="c"># Error:</span>
<span class="c"># ValueError: The following nodes were misnamed</span>
<span class="c">#   myCube</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Uh-oh. Looks like we've got a new error this time. By the looks of it, our Cube wasn't named according to the naming conventions. Let's try and remedy this. Currently, the naming convention is for everything you publish to always have a three-letter extension.</p>

<ol>
<li>Rename <code>myCube</code> to <code>myCube_GEO</code>
</li>
<li>Re-run the publish</li>
</ol><p>You should now see this message in your script editor.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-bash"><pre><span class="c"># Finished successfully #</span>
</pre></div>

<h1>
<a name="dissection" class="anchor" href="#dissection"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dissection</h1>

<p>Ok, let's back up a second and reflect on what happened. There are a couple of questions left unanswered from running your first publish above.</p>

<ol>
<li>Where did the publish go?</li>
<li>Why did it go there?</li>
<li>Where did the naming convention come from?</li>
<li>Why did we have to add the two attributes, <code>publishable</code> and <code>family</code>?</li>
<li>Why did we have to put <code>myCube</code> into a selection set?</li>
</ol><p>From the top:</p>

<ol>
<li>To your workspace.</li>
<li>Because the plugin <code>extract_as_ma</code> put it there.</li>
<li>From the plugin <code>validate_naming_convention</code>.</li>
<li>Because the plugin <code>select_object_set</code> was looking for it.</li>
<li>Because the plugin <code>select_object_set</code> was looking for this too.</li>
</ol><p>Too direct? Yes, let's have a closer look at how all of this fits together.</p>

<h3>
<a name="where-did-the-publish-go" class="anchor" href="#where-did-the-publish-go"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where did the publish go?</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>To your workspace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you look within your project directory, you'll notice that you've now got a new folder called <code>published</code>.</p>

<pre><code>C:\Users\marcus\Documents\maya\projects\default\published
</code></pre>

<p>This is where Pyblish chose to store <code>MyCube</code> when you hit the Publish button. But how did it know to do that? And why did it put it in a subdirectory that looks like the current date and time, followed by a few other directories?</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] [[/images/octicon-file-directory.png]] published

<ul>
<li>[ ] [[/images/octicon-file-directory.png]] 20140907-174550

<ul>
<li>[ ] [[/images/octicon-file-directory.png]] demo.model

<ul>
<li>[ ] [[/images/octicon-file-directory.png]] MyCube</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>And how did it know to produce 4 files? Why not 5, or 3? </p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] [[/images/octicon-file-directory.png]] MyCube

<ul>
<li>[ ] [[/images/octicon-file.png]] MyCube.ma</li>
<li>[ ] [[/images/octicon-file.png]] MyCube.mb</li>
<li>[ ] [[/images/octicon-file.png]] MyCube.obj</li>
<li>[ ] [[/images/octicon-file.png]] MyCube.mtl</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>Well, the answer lies in the plugins.</p>

<h4>
<a name="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it works</h4>

<p>If you haven't already done so, now would be an excellent time to read <a href="https://github.com/abstractfactory/pyblish/wiki/End-User-How-it-works">How It Works</a>. It'll provide you with an overview of how Pyblish processes your publishes. Once you're ready, come back here and we'll continue.</p>

</ul><h3>
<a name="5-minutes-later" class="anchor" href="#5-minutes-later"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>5 minutes later</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, so a selection plugin <em>selects</em> the cube?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. It knows to do this because of how it is implemented.</p>

<p>It looks for nodes of type <code>objectSet</code> in your scene; specifically, nodes with the two attributes we added - <code>publishable</code> and <code>family</code>.</p>

<p>If you were to remove any of these two, the selector would go blind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can I add anything to the <code>objectSet</code>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes you can! That is the whole idea - you add what you intend on sharing with others. This way, you can separate the part of your scene that is sharable from the part that is not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about the two attributes. What are they?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's a good question. The <code>publishable</code> is merely an attribute to help the selector distinguish the nodes you are interested in publishing from those you are not. It's a way for the node to say "Me! Me! Me!" when you've got three identical nodes in your scene.</p>

<p>Remember when Neo took the red pill and they were able to locate him amongst a field of pods identical to his own?</p>

<p><code>family</code> is where things start getting interesting. The family is a critical element of Pyblish. It's a way of saying "<em>this</em> instance belongs to <em>this</em> group of plugins". If you look at the selection set in your scene from your Attribute Editor, under "Extra Attributes", you'll see that the family attribute has the value "demo.model".</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-python"><pre><span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">cmds</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getAttr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'MyCube.family'</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>Yes, this is a way for the instance to say "I'd like all plugins compatible with <code>demo.model</code> to process me". Each plugin is associated with at least one (1) family. In effect, the instance is processed by a number of plugins compatible with this family.</p>

<p>I'm confused..</p>

<p>Don't worry, this will make more sense once we get a little bit further in learning about Pyblish. All you need to remember from this is that each plugin carries a list of supported families and that all instances carries exactly one (1) family that may or may not match any of the available plugins.</p>

<a name="why-did-the-publish-go-there" class="anchor" href="#why-did-the-publish-go-there"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why did the publish go there?</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Because the plugin <code>extract_as_ma</code> put it there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, if you remember from the <a href="https://github.com/abstractfactory/pyblish/wiki/End-User-How-it-works"><strong>How It Works</strong></a>, once selection and validation was complete, extraction took over. One of the extractors - specifically, one called <code>extract_as_ma</code> - is responsible for putting the files where they ended up.</p>

<p>Remember, the primary responsibility of an extractor is <em>getting data out of an application</em>. It doesn't have much concern for exactly where the data ends up, as that is not within its responsibilities. Instead, this responsibility is delegated to conformers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why couldn't the extractor just put the files where I want them right away?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They most certainly could, this is merely a guideline. The separation is made due to cases where you have one or more things happening to content once it exits an application.</p>

<ol>
<li>Data is moved to one location</li>
<li>Data is archived in another location</li>
<li>The event is logger with a task tracking solution</li>
</ol><p>For example, ask yourself these questions.</p>

<ul>
<li>What about when the network is down and it can't move the files to where they belong? </li>
<li>What about when the internet is down and the event can't be logged?</li>
<li>Should this stop the application from exporting the data?</li>
</ul><p>These are concerns well suited for conformers.</p>

<a name="where-did-the-naming-convention-come-from" class="anchor" href="#where-did-the-naming-convention-come-from"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where did the naming convention come from?</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>From the plugin <code>validate_naming_convention</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By now, you can probably answer the remaining questions yourself. But there is one important aspect I'd like to point out regarding the naming convention plugin.</p>

<p>The reason this naming convention was applied to "myCube_GEO" was because we specified that this cube was of family "demo.model".</p>

<p>We associated this family with our cube and in effect said "associate this particular naming convention to this cube".</p>

<h1>
<a name="conclusion" class="anchor" href="#conclusion"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Ok, time for a breather. </p>

<p>We've covered a lot of ground here but if there is one thing I'd like you to take with you it is that the manner in which we just published your first instance is fully dictated by the plugins currently exposed to Pyblish by the time you initiate your publish and that these plugins are just demos.</p>

<p>Pyblish is a "eat your own dog-food" library in that anything it does it does in the same manner you would do it if you were the one implementing the behaviour. We think this is important and it keeps us honest and our implementations open for learning and modification.</p>

<p>You're probably very excited about writing your own plugins by now, so let's do that! If you've saved your work (you'll need it next), head on the the next tutorial by clicking the link below.</p>
