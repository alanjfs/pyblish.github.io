# Integrations

You've just installed Pyblish, but Pyblish isn't much without any of its integrations. Head on over to our Autodesk Maya integration for further instructions on how to get setup.

If you have any other integrations in mind, do let us know and we'll get you set up on developing your very own integration with Pyblish!
