# Installing Pyblish for Maya

The following sections are instructions on how to get Pyblish up and running using Autodesk Maya.


If you haven't already installed Pyblish, head on over the the [installation guide][Pyblish] to get started. Once ready, run this.

```bash
# Pyblish for Maya is a regular Python package on PyPI
$ pip install pyblish-maya
```

> Pyblish is being tested using versions 2013, 2014 and 2015

[Pyblish]: #installation

### Installing the integration into Maya

The next step is to expose the integration to Maya. For this, you've got two options.

1. Append a `userSetup.py` to your PYTHONPATH

    ```bash
    # Typically, the integration is located here
    c:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\pyblish_maya\pythonpath
    ```

    Append this path to your `PYTHONPATH`. See here for [help with modifying your environment][var]

2. Append to your own `userSetup.py`

    ```bash
    # Typically located here:
    C:\Users\marcus\Documents\maya\scripts
    ```

     Append the following

     ```python
    import pyblish_maya.lib
    pyblish_maya.lib.register_plugins()
    pyblish_maya.lib.add_to_filemenu()
    ```

### Testing things out

The next time you open up Maya, look for an item in your `File` menu that reads "Publish". If you haven't got it, head over to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section and we'll get you sorted out.
