```
What is the relation between this project and Pipi/Abstract Factory?
```

Pipi is an open-source, next-generation pipeline developed at [Abstract Factory][]. We take part in the development of Pyblish, but Pyblish is ultimately designed to run standalone and to be flexible enough to fit into others currently active pipelines, without compromising how things are typically done.

```
Is this similar to project X?
```

By project X, you might be referring to other pipeline-related projects such as Shotgun, FTrack, 5th Kind, Tactic or even the newly announced Redcurrant. Pyblish wouldn't dream of such great endeavours and instead focuses on a very minimal mission of quality assuring outgoing data from digital content creation software. Other projects are better suited at organising and event-handling.
