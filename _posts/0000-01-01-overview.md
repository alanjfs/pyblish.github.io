# Fixing the world

One of the troubles facing visual effects- and game-facilities is maintaining a fixed level of quality throughout resources shared amongst artists within an organisation. Pyblish is a plug-in driven automation framework for content and solves exactly this.

Some of the immediate benefits of using Pyblish are

- [Higher quality content](#higher-quality-content)
- [Greater content reuse](#greater-reuse-of-content)
- [Lower iteration times](#lower-iteration-time)
- [Shortened learning curve](#shortened-learning-curve)

```
Higher quality content
```

Funnel content through strict procedures and provide guidance to fellow artists on how they can improve and follow contention. By the end of this, you'll end up with a uniform library of resources that all live up to your pre-defined measure of quality and a confidence that any resource fits any circumstance.

```
Greater reuse of content
```

Global quality measures can help you in reusing resources produced in one project together with resources built for another. As a result, every asset becomes an investment in the future.

```
Lowered iteration time
```

Sending resources back to their original creator is a major time sink. This can be reduced drastically, providing artists with the confidence to both contribute and use resources created by someone else.

```
Shortened learning curve
```

Without conventions, each resource is an island. Remove ad-hoc procedures and unify the interactions between every resource; have artists know with absolute certainty that if they can handle a resources of one class, they can handle any resource of the same class.
