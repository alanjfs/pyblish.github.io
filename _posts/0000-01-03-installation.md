# Installation

The best way to learn anything is to try things out.

```bash
# Pyblish is a regular Python package, available on PyPI
$ pip install pyblish
```

To test things out, let's try and import our newly installed package.

```python
>>> import pyblish
>>> pyblish.version
'0.1.16'
```

> If this isn't the results you've got, head on over to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) and we'll try and get things sorted.

Unless it said anything except how many tests it ran, you're good to go!
