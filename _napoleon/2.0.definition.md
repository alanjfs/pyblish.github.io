This chapter describes how Napoleon works and how to use it in your pipeline.

### Folder layout

Napoleon makes the following assumptions about your content.

> An [`Entity`](#glossary) represents both an Asset or a Shot

1. Development files are stored within each `entity` directory.
2. Published files are stored within each `entity` directory.
3. `Entities` are tagged with cQuery.
4. Development and published files have *independent versions*.

#### Encapsulation of content

- ![][dir] `Project`
    - ![][dir] `Asset`
        - ![][dir] `Development files`
        - ![][dir] `Published files`


Napoleon requires that your content is encapsulated and doesn't branch off into duplicate or mirrored hierarchies.

For example, the following layout is incompatible with Napoleon.

- ![][dir] `Project`
    - ![][dir] `Development`
    	- ![][dir] `Asset`
        	- ![][dir] `files`
    - ![][dir] `Published`
    	- ![][dir] `Asset`
        	- ![][dir] `files`

[file]: /images/octicon-file.png
[dir]: /images/octicon-file-directory.png

#### Schemaless content

- ![][dir] `Asset`
    - ![][dir] `.meta`
        - ![][file] `Asset`

Napoleon uses [cQuery][] to identify entities on disk. By tagging directories with either `Shot` or `Asset`, Napoleon can distinguish a plain directory from that of an [entity](#glossary), and in doing so provide critical information to plug-ins that integrate instances into the content hierarchy.

For example.

```bat
$ /projects/spiderman/MyAsset/wip/asset_wip_v001.mb
```

The parent Asset of this working file, `asset_wip_v001.mb` is `MyAsset`. For Napoleon to recognise this, we tag it using cQuery.

```bash
$ cd /project/spiderman/MyAsset
$ cquery Asset --tag
```

> Under the hood, cQuery is creating a zero-sized file within a directory of `MyAsset` called "Asset".

#### Content Definitions

```json
{
  "Asset": "Re-mixable, re-usable content",
  "Shot": "Combination of assets"
}
```

Napoleon defines two distinct types of content on disk; `Asset` and `Shot`.

Content is identified on disk using [cQuery][], a decentralised, schema-less tagging utility for content. Directories are tagged as being either an `Asset` or a `Shot`. The directory is then recognised by Napoleon and host published instances.

#### Instance Definitions

```json
{
  "type": "objectSet",
  "id": "pyblish.napoleon.instance"
}
```

An instance is identifier by type and ID. In Maya, an Instance is of type "objectSet" and carries the ID `pyblish.napoleon.instance`. By tagging the `objectSet` with this ID, Napoleon will recognise it as a Napoleon-conformant instance to be further processed by Napoleon plug-ins.
