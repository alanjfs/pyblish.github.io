# Napoleon

An asset framework for Pyblish.

Napoleon is a proof-of-concept of a **Pyblish [Workflow Extension](#glossary)** with the intent of inspiring you to codify your workflow. 

Currently, Napoleon:

- Provides a *pipeline* from modeling to final animation, including rigging.
- Provides *a number of families* that work together to shape assets and organise files.
- Extends the *native Plugin classes* with methods relevant to the Napoleon workflow.
- Illustrates how publishing options can be overridden/defined on a *per-instance basis*.

Napoleon is designed to be production-ready, but remains intent on providing you with inspiration and a solid understanding for how Pyblish can be used in your pipeline.
