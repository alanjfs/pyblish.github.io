# Installation

> Napoleon currently only supports Autodesk Maya version 2008 and upwards.

```bash
$ pip install pyblish-napoleon
```

#### Installation into Maya

To install Napoleon into Autodesk Maya, expose the Python library, such as via your `PYTHONPATH`. Next, add the following to your `userSetup.py`.

```python
import napoleon
napoleon.register_plugins()
```

Having done this, Pyblish will now have access to the Napoleon plug-ins and will publish instances corresponding to any of the provided families.

#### Installing from GitHub

If you'd rather install from source, ensure you've got the necessary dependencies.

```bash
$ pip install cquery
$ pip install openmetadata
```
